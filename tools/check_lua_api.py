# AN EVENT-CONTEXT FIELD CALLED AS A METHOD. `context.string` on a campaign event is a
# plain string field, so `context:string()` reads it (truthy), then calls it, and throws
# "attempt to call method 'string' (a string value)". CA never writes it: across the 831
# Lua files in reference/ca_scripts_wh3 there are 690 `context.string` FIELD reads and
# zero `:string()` calls of any kind, so this has no legitimate spelling to spare.
#
# WHY ONE LINE OF IT IS SO EXPENSIVE. The throw happens inside a listener callback, and
# CA's event_protected_callback xpcalls the callback but NOT the failure handler that runs
# afterwards - script_error escapes event_callback and every listener still queued behind
# the thrower is abandoned. Two such lines in zzz_derpy_iron_court_ui.lua starved 31
# PanelOpenedCampaign and 9 PanelClosedCampaign listeners - the Zharr Exchange, the
# commissions, the Tower of Zharr, MBXP, the Old World mod and other people's Workshop
# mods - for as long as the Iron Court had shipped, and NOTHING reached the script log.
